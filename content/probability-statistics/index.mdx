# Probability & Statistics

Probability and statistics form the foundation for understanding uncertainty in machine learning. They help us model randomness, make predictions, and quantify confidence in our results.

## Probability Theory

Probability measures the likelihood of events occurring. In machine learning, we use probability to model uncertainty in data and predictions.

### Basic Probability Rules

- **Addition Rule**: P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B)
- **Multiplication Rule**: P(A ∩ B) = P(A) × P(B|A)
- **Bayes' Theorem**: P(A|B) = P(B|A) × P(A) / P(B)

## Random Variables and Distributions

Random variables represent numerical outcomes of random events. Understanding distributions helps us model real-world phenomena.

### Common Distributions

- **Normal Distribution**: Bell-shaped curve, fundamental in many ML algorithms
- **Bernoulli Distribution**: Models binary outcomes
- **Uniform Distribution**: All outcomes equally likely

## Statistical Inference

Statistical methods allow us to draw conclusions about populations from sample data.

### Hypothesis Testing

We use hypothesis testing to determine if observed effects are statistically significant or due to random chance.

### Confidence Intervals

Confidence intervals provide a range of plausible values for unknown parameters.

## Applications in Machine Learning

Probability and statistics enable us to:
- Model uncertainty in predictions
- Evaluate model performance
- Design robust algorithms
- Make data-driven decisions
