# Probability & Statistics

I believe probability get's it's bad from the overly complicated formulas. But it really boils down to one simple idea 

`
Probability = Favourable events/All events
`

This is what my 11th grad professor told me, and I have never needed to change my believes since. It sounds like an oversimplification, but as we move forward.
You will see how all of probability, is just based on this simple idea.
