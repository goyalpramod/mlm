# Statistics for Machine Learning

Statistical methods provide the tools for making inferences about populations from samples, hypothesis testing, and evaluating the performance of machine learning models.

## Descriptive Statistics

Descriptive statistics summarize and describe the main features of a dataset.

**Measures of Central Tendency:**
- **Mean:** `μ = (1/n) Σᵢ xᵢ` - the average value
- **Median:** The middle value when data is ordered
- **Mode:** The most frequently occurring value

**Measures of Spread:**
- **Variance:** `σ² = (1/n) Σᵢ (xᵢ - μ)²`
- **Standard Deviation:** `σ = √(σ²)`
- **Range:** Maximum - Minimum

## Statistical Inference

Statistical inference allows us to make conclusions about a population based on a sample.

### Confidence Intervals

A confidence interval provides a range of plausible values for a population parameter. For a sample mean with known population standard deviation:

```
CI = x̄ ± z(α/2) × (σ/√n)
```

### Hypothesis Testing

Hypothesis testing is a statistical method for making decisions about population parameters based on sample data.

**The Process:**
1. State null hypothesis H₀ and alternative hypothesis H₁
2. Choose significance level α (typically 0.05)
3. Calculate test statistic
4. Determine p-value or compare with critical value
5. Make decision: reject or fail to reject H₀

**One-sample t-test:** Tests whether a sample mean differs from a hypothesized value:

```
t = (x̄ - μ₀) / (s/√n)
```

## Regression Analysis

Regression analysis is used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.

### Linear Regression

Linear regression models the relationship between variables using a linear equation:

```
y = β₀ + β₁x + ε
```

Where:
- `y` is the dependent variable
- `x` is the independent variable
- `β₀` is the y-intercept
- `β₁` is the slope
- `ε` is the error term
