# Optimization Theory

Optimization is the mathematical discipline of finding the best solution from a set of available alternatives. In machine learning, optimization algorithms find model parameters that minimize a loss function.

## Optimization Fundamentals

An optimization problem seeks to minimize (or maximize) an **objective function** `f(x)` subject to constraints. In machine learning contexts:

- **Loss function:** Measures how well model predictions match actual data
- **Cost function:** Often includes regularization terms to prevent overfitting
- **Parameters:** `x` represents model weights and biases

### Common Loss Functions

**Mean Squared Error (Regression):**
```
L(θ) = (1/2m) Σᵢ (hθ(xⁱ) - yⁱ)²
```

**Cross-entropy Loss (Classification):**
```
L(θ) = -(1/m) Σᵢ [yⁱ log(hθ(xⁱ)) + (1-yⁱ) log(1-hθ(xⁱ))]
```

## Gradient Descent

Gradient descent is the most fundamental optimization algorithm in machine learning. It iteratively moves in the direction of steepest descent to find a function's minimum.

### Basic Gradient Descent

The gradient `∇f(x)` points in the direction of steepest increase. To minimize `f(x)`, we move in the opposite direction:

```
x_{t+1} = x_t - α∇f(x_t)
```

Where `α` is the **learning rate** that controls the step size.

### Stochastic Gradient Descent

**Batch Gradient Descent:** Uses entire dataset
```
θ_{t+1} = θ_t - α ∇_θ (1/m) Σᵢ L(hθ(xⁱ), yⁱ)
```

**Stochastic Gradient Descent:** Uses single example
```
θ_{t+1} = θ_t - α ∇_θ L(hθ(xⁱ), yⁱ)
```

**Mini-batch Gradient Descent:** Uses small batch of examples
```
θ_{t+1} = θ_t - α ∇_θ (1/|B|) Σᵢ∈B L(hθ(xⁱ), yⁱ)
```

## Advanced Optimizers

Modern optimization algorithms improve upon basic gradient descent:

**Momentum:** Accelerates gradients in consistent directions
```
v_t = βv_{t-1} + (1-β)∇f(x_t)
x_{t+1} = x_t - αv_t
```

**Adam:** Combines momentum and adaptive learning rates
```
m_t = β₁m_{t-1} + (1-β₁)∇f(x_t)
v_t = β₂v_{t-1} + (1-β₂)(∇f(x_t))²
x_{t+1} = x_t - α(m̂_t/√(v̂_t + ε))
```

## Constrained Optimization

Many optimization problems include constraints that limit the feasible solutions.

### Lagrange Multipliers

For problems with equality constraints, Lagrange multipliers convert constrained optimization into unconstrained optimization:

**Problem:** Minimize `f(x)` subject to `g(x) = 0`

**Lagrangian:**
```
L(x,λ) = f(x) + λg(x)
```

**Optimality Conditions:**
```
∇_x L(x,λ) = ∇f(x) + λ∇g(x) = 0
∇_λ L(x,λ) = g(x) = 0
```
