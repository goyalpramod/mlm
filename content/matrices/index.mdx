# Advanced Matrix Theory

Building on basic linear algebra, this chapter explores advanced matrix operations and decompositions that are fundamental to machine learning algorithms.

## Matrix Decomposition

Matrix decomposition is the process of breaking down a matrix into simpler, more manageable components. These decompositions are fundamental to many machine learning algorithms.

### Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)

The Singular Value Decomposition is one of the most important matrix factorizations in machine learning. For any matrix `A ∈ ℝᵐˣⁿ`, SVD decomposes it as:

```
A = UΣVᵀ
```

Where:
- `U ∈ ℝᵐˣᵐ` is an orthogonal matrix (left singular vectors)
- `Σ ∈ ℝᵐˣⁿ` is a diagonal matrix of singular values
- `V ∈ ℝⁿˣⁿ` is an orthogonal matrix (right singular vectors)

SVD reveals the intrinsic dimensionality of data and is the mathematical foundation of Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

### LU Decomposition

LU decomposition factors a matrix into the product of a lower triangular matrix L and an upper triangular matrix U:

```
A = LU
```

This decomposition is particularly useful for solving systems of linear equations efficiently.

## Applications in Machine Learning

Matrix decompositions have direct applications in many machine learning techniques.

### Principal Component Analysis

PCA uses eigendecomposition or SVD to find the principal components of data - the directions of maximum variance.

For a data matrix X, PCA works with the covariance matrix:

```
C = (1/(n-1))XᵀX
```

### Linear Regression

Linear regression seeks to find the best-fitting line through data points. The normal equation solution uses matrix operations:

```
θ = (XᵀX)⁻¹Xᵀy
```

Where X is the feature matrix, y is the target vector, and θ are the model parameters.
