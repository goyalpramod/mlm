# Advanced Matrix Theory

Building on basic linear algebra, this chapter explores advanced matrix operations and decompositions that are fundamental to machine learning algorithms.

## Matrix Transformations

To begin, let $v$ be a vector (shown as a point) and $A$ be a matrix with columns $a_1$ and $a_2$ (shown as arrows). If we multiply $v$ by $A$, then $A$ sends $v$ to a new vector $Av$.

If you can draw a line through the three points $(0, 0)$, $v$ and $Av$, then $Av$ is just $v$ multiplied by a number $\lambda$; that is, $Av = \lambda v$. In this case, we call $\lambda$ an **eigenvalue** and $v$ an **eigenvector**. For example, here $(1, 2)$ is an eigenvector and $5$ an eigenvalue.

$$Av = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 8 & 1 \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} = 5 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} = \lambda v.$$

## Matrix Decomposition

Matrix decomposition is the process of breaking down a matrix into simpler, more manageable components. These decompositions reveal fundamental properties of linear transformations and enable efficient computation.

### Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)

The Singular Value Decomposition is one of the most important matrix factorizations in machine learning. For any matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$, SVD decomposes it as:

$$A = U\Sigma V^T$$

Where:
- $U \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times m}$ is an orthogonal matrix containing left singular vectors
- $\Sigma \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ is a diagonal matrix of singular values $\sigma_1 \geq \sigma_2 \geq \cdots \geq \sigma_r \geq 0$
- $V \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ is an orthogonal matrix containing right singular vectors

The singular values in $\Sigma$ are the square roots of the eigenvalues of $A^TA$:

$$\sigma_i = \sqrt{\lambda_i(A^TA)}$$

SVD reveals the intrinsic dimensionality of data and forms the mathematical foundation of Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

### Reduced SVD

For computational efficiency, we often use the reduced (or truncated) SVD:

$$A \approx U_k\Sigma_k V_k^T$$

Where we keep only the $k$ largest singular values, providing the best rank-$k$ approximation to $A$ in the Frobenius norm.

### LU Decomposition

LU decomposition factors a matrix into the product of a lower triangular matrix $L$ and an upper triangular matrix $U$:

$$A = LU$$

Where:
- $L$ has 1's on the diagonal and zeros above
- $U$ has zeros below the diagonal

This decomposition is particularly useful for solving systems of linear equations $A\vec{x} = \vec{b}$ efficiently:

1. First solve $L\vec{y} = \vec{b}$ (forward substitution)
2. Then solve $U\vec{x} = \vec{y}$ (backward substitution)

### QR Decomposition

QR decomposition expresses a matrix as the product of an orthogonal matrix $Q$ and an upper triangular matrix $R$:

$$A = QR$$

Where $Q^TQ = I$ (orthogonal) and $R$ is upper triangular.

This decomposition is stable for solving least squares problems and is used in the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization process.

## Eigendecomposition

For a square matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ with $n$ linearly independent eigenvectors, we can write:

$$A = PDP^{-1}$$

Where:
- $P$ contains the eigenvectors as columns
- $D$ is diagonal with eigenvalues $\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \ldots, \lambda_n$

For symmetric matrices, this becomes the spectral decomposition:

$$A = Q\Lambda Q^T$$

Where $Q$ is orthogonal and $\Lambda$ is diagonal with eigenvalues.

## Applications in Machine Learning

Matrix decompositions have direct applications in many machine learning techniques.

### Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

PCA uses eigendecomposition or SVD to find the principal components of data. For a centered data matrix $X \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ (m samples, n features), the covariance matrix is:

$$C = \frac{1}{m-1}X^TX$$

The eigenvectors of $C$ are the principal components, pointing in directions of maximum variance. The eigenvalues indicate the amount of variance explained by each component.

Using SVD on the data matrix directly:
$$X = U\Sigma V^T$$

The principal components are the columns of $V$, and the projected data is $X_{\text{proj}} = XV_k$ for the first $k$ components.

### Linear Regression via Normal Equations

Linear regression seeks to find parameters $\vec{\theta}$ that minimize the squared error. The normal equation solution uses matrix operations:

$$\vec{\theta} = (X^TX)^{-1}X^T\vec{y}$$

Where $X$ is the feature matrix and $\vec{y}$ is the target vector. This can be solved efficiently using QR decomposition or SVD.

### Matrix Factorization for Dimensionality Reduction

Low-rank matrix approximations reduce dimensionality while preserving important structure:

$$X \approx UV^T$$

Where $U \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times k}$ and $V \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times k}$ with $k \ll \min(m,n)$.

## Computational Considerations

### Condition Numbers

The condition number of a matrix $A$ is:

$$\kappa(A) = \frac{\sigma_{\max}}{\sigma_{\min}}$$

Where $\sigma_{\max}$ and $\sigma_{\min}$ are the largest and smallest singular values. Large condition numbers indicate numerical instability.

### Rank and Nullspace

The rank of matrix $A$ is the number of non-zero singular values. The nullspace (kernel) contains all vectors $\vec{x}$ such that $A\vec{x} = \vec{0}$.

For data analysis:
- **Full rank**: All features are linearly independent
- **Rank deficient**: Some features can be expressed as combinations of others

These concepts are essential for understanding feature selection, regularization, and the geometry of machine learning algorithms.
