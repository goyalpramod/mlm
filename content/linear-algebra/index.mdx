# Linear Algebra

Linear algebra sounds like such a scary topic when you first hear about it. But it soon becomes quite simple when you see what it really is. 
Just lines on an imaginary space. 

[Linear](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/linear) quite literally means lines, and algebra is just a complex word for naming and doing calculations 
on imaginary quatities. 

Now at times as you progress through the book, some scary archaic symbols, long equations, weird naming will be thrown at you. But I will be with you throughout the journey 
breaking down concepts into simple visuals and there most basic form. This [first principles thinking](https://fs.blog/first-principles/) will help you throughout your adventure of learning ML. 

Remember what we said, Linear algebra is just lines on imaginary space. Nothing too scary about that. 

## Vectors & Vector Spaces

### What are Vectors?

Depending on which field of study you come from a vector can mean different things to you. The confusion is made worse when we talk about vectors in code (1D array)
and in math.

We will keep it simple and build all our ideas on these 3 points:

* A vector has a direction 
* A vector has a magnitude 
* A vector follows the parallelogram law of vector addition 

[ADD_SIMPLE_VECTOR]

We can understand the first two points by drawing a vector in the [coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_system) (now now, I assume you do know 10th grade math). 

We can see that relative to the X axis, our vector $A$ has a direction, and the length of the vector represents it's magnitude. We will talk about the 3rd point in a little while.

We did not tackle one question yet, how do we write down a vector? This can be simplified by again drawing our coordinate system and making a vector on it. 

[ADD_SIMPLE_VECTOR]

This time let's add units to our coordinate system, We can say that $A$ is 3 units to the right of X axis and 4 units above the Y axis. 

$$
A = 3\hat{x} + 4\hat{y}
$$

The hat that our x & y are wearing represents unit vectors (Funny enough they are called x hat and y hat). We have defined a quantitative way to represnt vectors. 

### Vector Operations



#### Scalar Multiplication

Another uncessarily scary word. Scalar just means a number that scales. So when we multiply our vector with a scalar, it scales it by that number.
Go ahead, try writing a scalar number lambda ($\lambda$) and see how our vector changes. 

[ADD scalar multiplication]

#### Vector Addition

Playing alone is quite boring, it's always more fun with friends. So let's introduce another vector B in our coordinate system

<VectorAddition />

The parallelogram of vector addition is how two vectors are added, If we have $\vec{A}$ and $\vec{B}$ vectors we simply cannot add them to get a vector $C$ we must follow the above law. 
(Drag the vectors around to see how the output changes)

If you are a true first principles thinker, you may question why we are doing this. Well, that is how we define vectors. It's like asking why is a chicken a chicken, it's simply state of being.

#### Dot Product

[WRONG DOT PRODUCT GIVES BACK SCALAR] [ALSO MENTION INNER OR SCALAR PRODUCT]

I believe this is the most fundamental equation in all of ML, any and all models you build or use. Uses this fundamentally.

A dot product of vectors is basically how vectors are multiplied, let's go back to our drawing board and see how the following is calculated 

$$
\vec{C} = \vec{A}.\vec{B}
$$

[Write the equations]

The equations are quite boring I will say, it's no fun if you cannot imagine or see it. So let's do that. 

We can split our vector A into 3 x hat and 4 y hat (Remember our awesome law of parallelogram addition, that lets us do this.)
Similarily we can split vector B 

[ADD IMAGE OF SPLITING ONE VECTOR TO X AND Y AXIS]

now the simple rule of vector dot product is, similar units multiply with similar units. 

[ADD VISUAL OF C Vector]

So we get C vector, This has many implicantions that we will learn in the future. One simple way to think about it, is that if we have a main vector
