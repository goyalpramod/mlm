# Linear Algebra Fundamentals

Linear algebra forms the mathematical foundation of machine learning. At its core are vectors - mathematical objects that represent both magnitude and direction.

## Vectors and Vector Spaces

A vector is an ordered collection of numbers. In machine learning, we typically work with column vectors. For example, a 3-dimensional vector can be written as:

```
v = [v₁, v₂, v₃]ᵀ
```

Where `v₁`, `v₂`, and `v₃` are the components of the vector.

### Vector Operations

Several fundamental operations can be performed on vectors:

**Vector Addition:** When we add two vectors of the same dimension, we add their corresponding components:

```
a + b = [a₁ + b₁, a₂ + b₂, a₃ + b₃]ᵀ
```

**Scalar Multiplication:** Multiplying a vector by a scalar scales all components:

```
c · v = [c·v₁, c·v₂, c·v₃]ᵀ
```

**Dot Product:** The dot product of two vectors produces a scalar:

```
a · b = a₁b₁ + a₂b₂ + a₃b₃
```

## Matrix Operations

Matrices are rectangular arrays of numbers that can be thought of as collections of vectors. In machine learning, matrices represent datasets, transformations, and model parameters.

### Matrix Fundamentals

A matrix A with m rows and n columns is denoted as `A ∈ ℝᵐˣⁿ`. Each element is accessed using row and column indices: `A[i,j]` or `aᵢⱼ`.

### Matrix Multiplication

Matrix multiplication is fundamental to many machine learning algorithms. For matrices `A ∈ ℝᵐˣⁿ` and `B ∈ ℝⁿˣᵖ`, their product `C = AB` has dimensions `m × p`.

## Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors

Eigenvalues and eigenvectors reveal important properties of linear transformations and are essential for understanding dimensionality reduction techniques.

For a square matrix A, an eigenvector v and its corresponding eigenvalue λ satisfy:

```
Av = λv
```

This concept is crucial for Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and understanding data structure.
