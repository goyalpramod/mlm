# Machine Learning

Machine learning brings together all the mathematical concepts we've explored - linear algebra, calculus, probability, and optimization - to create systems that can learn from data and make predictions.

## The Mathematical Foundation

Every machine learning algorithm relies on the mathematical concepts we've studied:

- **Linear Algebra**: Represents data as vectors and matrices
- **Calculus**: Optimizes model parameters through gradient descent
- **Probability**: Models uncertainty and makes probabilistic predictions
- **Optimization**: Finds the best model parameters

## Supervised Learning

In supervised learning, we learn from labeled examples to make predictions on new data.

### Linear Regression

Linear regression uses linear algebra to find the best line through data points:

```
y = Xβ + ε
```

Where:
- y is the target vector
- X is the feature matrix
- β is the parameter vector
- ε is the error term

### Neural Networks

Neural networks combine linear transformations with nonlinear activation functions:

```
h = σ(Wx + b)
```

## Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning finds hidden patterns in data without labeled examples.

### Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

PCA uses eigenvalue decomposition to reduce dimensionality while preserving variance.

### Clustering

Clustering algorithms group similar data points using distance metrics from linear algebra.

## Model Evaluation

We use statistical methods to evaluate how well our models perform:

- **Cross-validation**: Estimates model performance on unseen data
- **Confidence intervals**: Quantify uncertainty in predictions
- **Hypothesis testing**: Determine statistical significance

## The Learning Process

Machine learning is fundamentally an optimization problem where we minimize a loss function using calculus-based methods like gradient descent.
